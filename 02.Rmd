# Some basic concepts  

Statistics is all about making sense of data, and to do that effectively, you need to understand some fundamental concepts. In this chapter, we will explore some basic concepts in statistics that are essential for anyone who wants to analyze data.  


## Population and Sample  

Consider the following example.Suppose we wish to study the body masses
of all students of College of Agriculture, Vellayani. It will take us a
long time to measure the body masses of all students of the college and
so we may select 20 of the students and measure their body masses (in
kg). Suppose we obtain the measurements like this  


49 56 48 61 59 43 58 52 64 71 57 52 63 58 51 47 57 46 53 59  

In this study, we are interested in the body masses of all students of
College of Agriculture, Vellayani. The set of body masses of all
students of College of Agriculture, Vellayani is called the
**population** of this study. The set of 20 body masses, *W* = {49,
56,48, ..., 53, 59}, is a **sample** from this population.



### Population

A population is the set of all objects we wish to study.  

In statistics, a population refers to the entire group of individuals, objects, or events that we are interested in studying. It is the entire set of units or elements that share one or more characteristics of interest to the researcher. The population can be of any size, depending on the research question and the resources available to the researcher.  

For example, if a researcher is interested in studying the attitudes of all the farmers in a village, the population would be all the farmers in that village. If a researcher is interested in studying the prevalence of a disease in cattle in a particular area only, the population would be all the cattle in that area.  

It is important to define the population clearly, as it forms the basis for sampling and making inferences about the larger group.  

### Sample

A sample is part of the population we study to learn about the
population.  

In statistics, a sample is a subset of a population that is selected for study. The purpose of taking a sample is to study a smaller group of individuals, objects, or events from the larger population, and to use the information obtained from the sample to make inferences about the population as a whole.  

Sampling is a crucial part of statistical analysis, as it allows researchers to study a population without having to study every individual, which can be time-consuming and costly. The sample should be selected in a way that is representative of the population of interest, so that the results of the study can be generalized to the larger population.  

The size of the sample also plays an important role in determining the accuracy of the estimates. Generally, the larger the sample size, the more accurate the estimates are likely to be.

## Variables and constants

### Variables


Any type of observation which can take different values for different
people, or different values at different times, or places, is called a
variable. The following are examples of variables:

-   family size, number of hospital beds, number of schools in a
    country, etc.

-   height, mass, blood pressure, temperature, blood glucose level, etc.




Broadly speaking, there are two types of variables -- **quantitative**
and **qualitative** (or categorical) variables



### Constants


Constants are characteristics that have values that do not change.
Examples of constants are: pi ($\pi$) = the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter ($\pi$ = 3.14159\...) and *e*, the base of the
natural or (Napierian) logarithms (*e*=2.71828).



## Types of variables

### Quantitative variables

A quantitative variable is one that can take numerical values. The
variables like family size, number of hospital beds, number of schools
in a country, height, mass, blood pressure, temperature, blood glucose
level, etc. are examples of quantitative variables. Quantitative
variables may be characterized further as to whether they are discrete
or continuous

### Discrete variables

The variables like family size, number of hospital beds, number of
schools in a country, etc. can be counted. These are examples of
discrete variables. Variables that can only take on a finite number of
values are called "discrete variables." Any variable phrased as "the
number of ...", is discrete, because it is possible to list its possible
values {0,1, ...}. Any variable with a finite number of possible values
is discrete. The following example illustrates the point. The number of
daily admissions to a hospital is a discrete variable since it can be
represented by a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 or 3. The number of daily
admissions on a given day cannot be a number such as 1.8, 3.96 or 5.33.

### Continuous variables

The variables like height, mass, blood pressure, temperature, blood
glucose level, etc. can be measured. These are examples of continuous
variables. A continuous variable does not possess the gaps or
interruptions characteristic of a discrete variable. A continuous
variable can assume any value within a specific relevant interval of
values assumed by the variable. Notice that age is continuous since an
individual does not age in discrete jumps. Weight can be measured as
35.5, 35.8 kg etc so, it is a continuous variable.

### Categorical variables

A variable is called categorical when the measurement scale is a set of
categories. For example, marital status, with categories
(single,married, widowed), is categorical. Whether employed (yes, no),
religious affiliation (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, others,
none), colours etc. Categorical variables are often called qualitative.
It can be seen that categorical variables can neither be measured nor
counted.

## Measurement scales

Variables can further be classified according to the following four
levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.

### Nominal scale

This scale of measure applies to qualitative variables only. On the
nominal scale, no order is required. For example,gender is nominal,
blood group is nominal, and marital status is also nominal. We cannot
perform arithmetic operations on data measured on the nominal scale.

### Ordinal scale

This scale also applies to qualitative data. On the ordinal scale, order
is necessary. This means that one category is lower than the next one or
vice versa. For example, Grades are ordinal, as excellent is higher than
very good, which in turn is higher than good, and so on. It should be
noted that, in the ordinal scale, differences between category values
have no meaning.

### Interval scale

This scale of measurement applies to quantitative data only. In this
scale, the zero point does not indicate a total absence of the quantity
being measured. An example of such a scale is temperature on the Celsius
or Fahrenheit scale. Suppose the minimum temperatures of 3 cities, A, B
and C, on a particular day were 0^0^C, 20^0^C and 10^0^C, respectively.
It is clear that we can find the differences between these temperatures.
For example, city B is 20^0^C hotter than city A. However, we cannot say
that city A has no temperature. Moreover, we cannot say that city B is
twice as hot as city C, just because city B is 20^0^C and city C is
10^0^C. The reason is that, in the interval scale, the ratio between two
numbers is not meaningful.

### Ratio scale

This scale of measurement also applies to quantitative data only and has
all the properties of the interval scale. In addition to these
properties, the ratio scale has a meaningful zero starting point and a
meaningful ratio between 2 numbers. An example of variables measured on
the ratio scale, is weight. A weighing scale that reads 0 kg gives an
indication that there is absolutely no weight on it. So the zero
starting point is meaningful. If Ram weighs 40 kg and Laxman weighs 20
kg, then Ram weighs twice as Laxman. Another example of a variable
measured on the ratio scale is temperature measured on the Kelvin scale.
This has a true zero point.

## Data  

Data can be defined as individual pieces of factual information recorded
and used for the purpose of analysis. It is the raw information from
which inferences are drawn using the science "STATISTICS".  

Data refers to information that is collected and recorded for analysis. This information can be in the form of numbers, text, images, or other formats and can be obtained from a variety of sources. The analysis of data can help to identify patterns, trends, and relationships, and can be used to inform decision making in many different fields.  


Example for data

-   No. of farmers in a block.

-   The rainfall over a period of time.

-   Area under paddy crop in a state.  

-   Images of rice blast disease  


## Collection of Data

The first step in any enquiry (investigation) is the collection of data.
The data may be collected for the whole population or for a sample only.
It is mostly collected on a sample basis. Collecting data is very
difficult job. The enumerator or investigator is the well trained
individual who collects the statistical data. The respondents are the
persons from whom the information is collected.

### Types of Data

There are two types (sources) for the collection of data:  
* Primary Data  

* Secondary Data  

#### Primary Data

Primary data are the first hand information which is collected, compiled
and published by organizations for some purpose. They are the most
original data in character and have not undergone any sort of
statistical treatment.

Example: Population census reports are primary data because these are
collected, complied and published by the population census organization.

#### Secondary Data

The secondary data are the second hand information which is already
collected by an organization for some purpose and are available for the
present study. Secondary data are not pure in character and have
undergone some treatment at least once.

Example: An economic survey of England is secondary data because the
data are collected by more than one organization like the Bureau of
Statistics, Board of Revenue, banks, etc.

## Methods of Collecting Primary Data

Primary data are collected using the following methods:

### Personal Investigation

The researcher conducts the survey him/herself and collects data from
it. The data collected in this way are usually accurate and reliable.
This method of collecting data is only applicable in case of small
research projects.

### Through Investigation

Trained investigators are employed to collect the data. These
investigators contact the individuals and fill in questionnaires after
asking for the required information. Most organizations utilize this
method.

### Collection through Questionnaire

Researchers get the data from local representations or agents that are
based upon their own experience. This method is quick but gives only a
rough estimate.

### Through the Telephone

Researchers get information from individuals through the telephone. This
method is quick and gives accurate information.

## Methods of Collecting Secondary Data

Secondary data are collected by the following methods:

### Official

Publications from the Statistical Division, Ministry of Finance, the
Federal Bureaus of Statistics, Ministries of Food, Agriculture,
Industry, Labor, etc.

### Semi-Official

-   Publications from State Bank, Railway Board, Central Cotton
    Committee, Boards of Economic Enquiry etc.\
-   Publication of Trade Associations, Chambers of Commerce, etc.\
-   Technical and Trade Journals and Newspapers.\
-   Research Organizations such as universities and other institutions.

## Difference Between Primary and Secondary Data

The difference between primary and secondary data is only a change of
hand. Primary data are the first hand information which is directly
collected form one source. They are the most original in character and
have not undergone any sort of statistical treatment, while secondary
data are obtained from other sources or agencies. They are not pure in
character and have undergone some treatment at least once.
