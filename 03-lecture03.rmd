# Measures of central tendency - I

In the previous lecture, you have learnt how data can be summarised in
the form of tables and presented in the form of graphs so that important
features can be illustrated easily and more effectively. In this
Lecture, we consider statistical measures which can be used to describe
the characteristics of a set of data.

We are interested in a single value that serves as a representative
value of the overall data. A **measure of central tendency** is a
summary statistic that represents the centre point or typical value of a
dataset.

There are five averages. Among them mean, median and mode are called
**simple averages** and the other two averages geometric mean and harmonic
mean are called **special averages**. These measures reflect numerical
values in the centre of a set of data and are therefore called measures
of central tendency.

[**Requisites of a Good Measure of Central Tendency:**]{.ui}

-   It should be rigidly defined.

-   It should be simple to understand & easy to calculate

-   It should be based upon all values of given data

-   It should be capable of further mathematical treatment.

-   It should have sampling stability.

-   It should be not be unduly affected by extreme values

[The main objectives of Measure of Central Tendency]{.ui}  

-   To condense data in a single value.

-   To facilitate comparisons between data.

## Arithmetic Mean

This is what people usually intend when they say \"average\". Arithmetic
mean or simply the mean of a variable is defined as the sum of the
observations divided by the number of observations. Mean of set of
numbers $x_{1\ },x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}$ is denoted as $\overline{x}$. It is
given by the formula

$$\overline{x} = \frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + \ldots + x_{n}}{n}$$

$= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i}$

**Example 3.1** Find the mean of the numbers 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12

$$\overline{x} = \frac{2 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 12}{6} = \frac{44}{6} = 7.33$$

### The mean of a frequency distribution

#### Direct method

If the numbers $x_{1\ },x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}$ occur with frequencies
$f_{1\ },f_{2},\ldots,f_{n}$ respectively then

$$\overline{x} = \frac{x_{1}f_{1} + x_{2}f_{2\ \ } + \ldots + x_{n}f_{n}}{f_{1} + f_{2} + \ldots f_{n}}$$

$$= \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}x_{i}}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_{i}}$$

**Example 3.2** Table below shows the body masses of 50 men. Find the
mean body mass.  

Table: (\#tab:bodymass) Body masses of 50 men.

  Frequency   3    9    23   11   4

**Solution 3.2**

The calculation can be arranged as shown

  Mass(*x*)   Frequency(*f*)                *fx*

  61          23                            1403
  62          11                            682
  63          4                             252
              $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_{i}$= 50   $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}x_{i}}$= 3054

$\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}x_{i}}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_{i}} = \frac{3054}{50}$=
61.08 kg

#### Assumed mean method (Indirect method)

The amount of computation involved above can be reduced by using the
following formula:

$$\overline{x} = A + \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}d_{i}}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_{i}}$$

Where $A$ is the assumed mean, which can be any value in *x*.
$d_{i} = x_{i} - A$, $f_{i}$ is the frequency of $x_{i}$

Consider the Example 2.2 see Table: \@ref(tab:bodymass)

let $A$ = 61; it can be any number in *x*

    Mass(*x*)   Frequency(*f*)                $$\mathbf{d}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{-}\mathbf{61}$$   $$\mathbf{f}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{d}_{\mathbf{i}}$$

  62          11                            1                                                                                   11

              $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_{i}$= 50                                                                                       $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}d_{i}}$= 4

$\overline{x} = 61 + \frac{4}{50}$ = 61.08 kg

The mean mass is 61.08 kg

### Mean of Grouped Data

#### Direct method

The mean for grouped data is obtained from the following formula:

$$\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{k}{f_{i}x_{i}}}{n}$$

Where $x_{i}$ = the mid-point of *i*^th^ class (*i*^th^ class mark);
$f_{i}$= the frequency of *i*^th^ class; $n$ = the sum of the
frequencies or total frequencies in a sample. Note that *i* =1,2\...,
*k*, *i*.*e*. there are *k* classes.

$\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}x_{i}}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_{i}} = \frac{4365}{60}$=
72.75

The mean mark is 72.75%

#### Coding method (Indirect method)

If all the class intervals of a grouped frequency distribution have equal size $C$ (class width); then the following formula can be used instead of direct method above. This formula makes calculations easier.

$$\overline{x} = A + C\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}u_{i}}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_{i}}$$

Where $A$ is the he class mark with the highest frequency,
$u_{i} = \frac{x_{i} - A}{C}$, $f_{i}$ is the frequency of $x_{i}$, *C*
is the class width

This is called the "coding" method for computing the mean. It is a very short method and should always be used for finding the mean of a grouped frequency distribution with equal class widths.

Consider the Example 3.3 see Table:\@ref(tab:phy) 

$A$=72.5, class mark with highest frequency; $C$ =5

$\overline{x} = 72.5 + 5 \times \left( \frac{3}{60} \right)$= 72.75

## Merits and demerits of Arithmetic mean Merits

[**Merits **]{.ul}

1.  It is rigidly defined.

2.  It is easy to understand and easy to calculate.

3.  If the number of items is sufficiently large, it is more accurate
    and more reliable.

4.  It is a calculated value and is not based on its position in the
    series.

5.  It is possible to calculate even if some of the details of the data
    are lacking.

6.  Of all averages, it is affected least by fluctuations of sampling.

7.  It provides a good basis for comparison.

[**Demerits**]{.ul}

1.  It cannot be obtained by inspection nor located through a frequency
    graph.

2.  It cannot be in the study of qualitative phenomena not capable of
    numerical measurement *i*.*e*. Intelligence, beauty, honesty etc.

3.  It can ignore any single item only at the risk of losing its
    accuracy.

4.  It is affected very much by extreme values.

5.  It cannot be calculated for open-end classes.

6.  It may lead to fallacious conclusions, if the details of the data
    from which it is computed are not given.  
    
## The median

**The median** of a set of data is defined as the middle value when the
data is arranged in order of magnitude. If there are no ties, half of
the observations will be smaller than the median, and half of the
observations will be larger than the median. The median can be the
middle most item that divides the group into two equal parts, one part
comprising all values greater, and the other, all values less than that
item. It is a positional measure.

### Median of ungrouped or raw data

Arrange the given *n* observations $x_{1\ },x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}$ in
ascending order. If the number of values is odd, median is the middle
value. If the number of values is even, median is the mean of middle two
values.

Arrange data in ascending then use the following formula

When *n* is odd, Median = Md
=$\left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right)^{\text{th}}$value

When *n* is even, Median = Md
=${\text{Average\ of\ }\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)^{th}\text{and\ }\left( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \right)}^{\text{th}}$value

**Example 3.4** Find the median of each of the following sets of
numbers.

\(a\) 12, 15, 22, 17, 20, 26, 22, 26, 12

\(b\) 4, 7, 9, 10, 5, 1, 3, 4, 12, 10

**Solution 3.4**

\(a\) Arranging the data in an increasing order of magnitude, we
obtain 12, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 22, 26, 26. Here, N (= 9) is odd, and so,
median =$\left( \frac{9 + 1}{2} \right)^{\text{th}}$= 5^th^ ordered
observation = 20.

Note: If a number is repeated, we still count it the number of times it
appears when we calculate the median.

\(b\) Arranging the data in an increasing order of magnitude, we obtain
1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 10, 12. Here, N(=10) is an even number and so
median = $\frac{1}{2}${5^th^ ordered observation + 6^th^ ordered
observation} = $\frac{1}{2}\left( 5 + 7 \right) = 6$.

Note: You can see in each case, the median divides the distribution into
two equal parts, with 50% of the observations greater than it and the
other 50% less than it.

### Median of ungrouped frequency distribution

The median is the middle number is an ordered set of data. In a
frequency table, the observations are already arranged in an ascending
order. We can obtain the median by looking for the value in the middle
position.

#### Median of a frequency table when the number of observations is odd

When the number of observations (n) is odd, then the median is the value
at the $\left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right)^{\text{th}}$ positional value.
For that we use less than cumulative frequency.

**Example 3.5**: The following is a frequency table of the score obtained in a mathematics quiz. Find the median score.  

Table: (\#tab:score) Score obtained in a mathematics quiz.  

  **Score**       0   1   2   3   4
  --------------- --- --- --- --- ---
  **Frequency**   3   4   7   6   3

**Solution 3.5:**

Total frequency = 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 23 (odd number). Since the number
of scores is odd, the median is at
$\left( \frac{23 + 1}{2} \right)^{\text{th}} =$ 12^th^ position. To find
out the 12^th^ position, we use less than cumulative frequencies as
shown:

  **Score**                            0   1   **2**    3    4
  ------------------------------------ --- --- -------- ---- ----
  **Frequency**                        3   4   **7**    6    3
  **less than cumulative frequency**   3   7   **14**   20   23

The 12^th^ position is after the 7^th^ position but before the
14^th^ position. So, the median is 2.

#### Median of a frequency table when the number of observations is even

When the number of observations is even, then the median is the average
of
${\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)^{th}\text{and\ }\left( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \right)}^{\text{th}}$
position values.

**Example 3.6**: The table is a frequency table of the marks obtained in a competition. Find the median score.  

Table: (\#tab:median) Distribution of marks obtained in a competition.  

  **Mark**        0    1   2   3    4
  --------------- ---- --- --- ---- ----
  **Frequency**   11   9   5   10   15

**Solution 3.6**:

Total frequency = 11 + 9 + 5 + 10 + 15 = 50 (even number). Since the
number of scores is even, the median is at the average of the values in
${\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)^{th} = 25\ and\ \left( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \right)}^{\text{th}} = 26$
positions. To find out the 25^th^ position and 26^th^ position, we add up the frequencies as shown:

  **Mark**                             0    1    2    3    4
  ------------------------------------ ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
  **Frequency**                        11   9    5    10   15
  **less than cumulative frequency**   11   20   25   35   50

The mark at the 25^th^ position is 2 and the mark at the 26^th^ position
is 3. The median is the average of the scores at 25^th^ and
26^th^ positions = $\frac{2 + 3}{2} = 2.5$

### Median of grouped frequency distribution  

The exact value of the median of a grouped data cannot be obtained
because the actual values of a grouped data are not known. For a grouped
frequency distribution, the median is in the class interval which
contains the $\left( \frac{N}{2} \right)^{\text{th}}$ordered
observation, where $N$ is the total number of observations. This class
interval is called the **median class**. The median of a grouped
frequency distribution can be estimated by either of the following two
methods:

#### Linear interpolation method for estimating the median

The median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated by
linear interpolation. We assume that the observations are evenly spread
through the median class. The median can then be computed by using the
following formula:

$$median = L + \left( \frac{\frac{1}{2}N - F}{f_{m}} \right)C$$

where $N$ = total number of observations, $L$ = lower limit of the
median class, $F$ = sum of all frequencies below *L*(cumulative
frequency), $f_{m}$ = frequency of the median class, $C$ = class width
of the median class.

#### Estimation of the median from a cumulative frequency curve

The median of a grouped frequency distribution can be estimated from a
cumulative frequency curve. A horizontal line is drawn from the point
$\frac{\text{N\ }}{2}$ on the vertical axis to meet the cumulative
frequency curve. From the point of intersection, a vertical line is
dropped to the horizontal axis. The value on the horizontal axis is
equal to the median.

**Solution 3.7**

**(i) Linear interpolation method for estimating the median**

$N$ = 60

Median class= class interval which contains the
$\left( \frac{N}{2} \right)^{\text{th}}$ordered observation; here
$\left( \frac{60}{2} \right)^{\text{th}} =$ 30^th^ observation. Before
the class 160-165 there are 3+9+16=28 observations so 30^th^ observation
will be in the class 160-165, therefore it is the median class.

$L$ = lower limit of the median class =160

$F$ = sum of all frequencies below 160(cumulative frequency) = 16+9+3=
28

$f_{m}$ = frequency of the median class=18

$C$ = class width of the median class=5

$median = 160 + \left( \frac{\frac{1}{2}60 - 28}{18} \right)5$ = 160.56

**(ii) Estimation of the median from a cumulative frequency curve**

## Merits and Demerits of Median

[**Merits**]{.ul}

1.  Median is not influenced by extreme values because it is a
    positional average.

2.  Median can be calculated in case of distribution with open-end
    intervals

3.  Median can be located even if the data are incomplete.

[**Demerits**]{.ul}

1.  A slight change in the series may bring drastic change in median
    value.

2.  In case of even number of items or continuous series, median is an
    estimated value other than any value in the series.

3.  It is not suitable for further mathematical treatment except its use
    in calculating mean deviation.

4.  It does not take into account all the observations

## The mode

The mode of a set of data is the value which occurs with the greatest
frequency. The mode is therefore the most common value. The mode is an
important measure in case of qualitative data. The mode can be used to
describe both quantitative and qualitative data.

### Mode of ungrouped or raw data

For ungrouped data or a series of individual observations, mode is often
found by mere inspection.

**Example 3.8**

\(a\) The mode of 1, 2, 2, 2, 3 is 2.

\(b\) The modes of 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5 are 4 and 5.

\(c\) The mode does not exist when every observation has the same frequency. For example, the following sets of data have no modes: (i) 3,
6, 8, 9; (ii) 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9.

Note: It can be seen that the mode of a distribution may not exist, and
even if it exists, it may not be unique. Distributions with a single
mode are referred to as *unimodal*. Distributions with two modes are
referred to as *bimodal*. Distributions may have several modes, in which
case they are referred to as *multimodal*.

**Example 3.9** 20 patients selected at random had their blood groups
determined. The results are given in the table below  

Table: (\#tab:Blood) Blood groups of 20 patients  

  Blood group       A   AB   B   O
  ----------------- --- ---- --- ---
  No. of patients   2   4    6   8

The blood group with the highest frequency is O. The mode of the data is
therefore blood group O. We can say that most of the patients selected
have blood group O. Notice that the mean and the median cannot be
applied to the data. This is because the variable "blood group" cannot
take numerical values. However, it can be seen that the mode can be used
to describe both quantitative and qualitative data.

### Mode of Grouped frequency distribution

$$mode = L + \left( \frac{f_{s}}{f_{p} + f_{s}} \right)C$$

Locate the highest frequency the class corresponding to that frequency
is called the **modal class**.

Where $L$ = lower limit of the model class; $f_{p}$= the frequency of
the class preceding the model class; $f_{s}$= the frequency of the class
succeeding the model class and $C$ = class interval

**Example 3.10** For the frequency distribution of weights of sorghum
ear-heads given in table below. Calculate the mode.  

Table: (\#tab:earhead)requency distribution of weights of sorghum ear heads  

  Weights of ear heads (g)   No of ear heads (*f*)
  -------------------------- -----------------------
  60-80                      22
  80-100                     38
  100-120                    45
  120-140                    35
  140-160                    20

Modal class is **100-120**

$mode = 100 + \left( \frac{35}{38 + 35} \right)20 =$ 109.589

### **Mode using Histogram**

Consider the figure below. The modal class is the class interval which
corresponds to rectangle $\text{ABCD}$. An estimate of the mode of the
distribution is the abscissa of the point of intersection of the line
segments $\overline{\text{AE}}$and $\overline{\text{BF}}$in

```

## Merits and Demerits of Mode

[*Merits*]{.ul}

1.  It is readily comprehensible and easy to compute. In some case it
    can be computed merely by inspection.

2.  It is not affected by extreme values. It can be obtained even if the
    extreme values are not known.

3.  Mode can be determined in distributions with open classes.

4.  Mode can be located on the graph also.

5.  Mode can be used to describe both quantitative and qualitative data.

[*Demerits*]{.ul}

1.  The mode is not unique. That is, there can be more than one mode for
    a given set of data.

2.  The mode of a set of data may not exist

3.  It is not based upon all the observation.
