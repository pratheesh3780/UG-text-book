# Frequency distribution   

Frequency distribution is an essential tool in statistics that summarizes the distribution of a dataset by showing how often each value occurs. A frequency distribution provides a visual representation of the data that allows for easy interpretation and analysis. Example below will help you understand more about frequency distribution.  

Table shows the number of children per family for 54 families selected
from a town in India. The data, presented in this form in which it was
collected, is called raw data.

```{r raw, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='raw data set of No. of children in 54 families',out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image3.jpeg"))
```

It can be seen that, the minimum and the maximum numbers of children per
family are 0 and 4, respectively. Apart from these numbers, it is
impossible, without further careful study, to extract any exact
information from the data. But by breaking down the data into the form
below

```{r freq, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Frequency distribution table',out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image4.png"))
```

Now certain features of the data become apparent. For instance, it can
easily be seen that, most of the 54 families selected have two children
because number of houses having 2 children is 18. This information
cannot easily be obtained from the raw data. The above table is called a
frequency table or a frequency distribution. It is so called because it
gives the frequency or number of times each observation occurs. Thus, by
finding the frequency of each observation, a more intelligible picture
is obtained.

### Construction of frequency distribution

1.  List all values of the variable in ascending order of magnitude.

2.  Form a tally column, that is, for each value in the data, record a
    stroke in the tally column next to that value. In the tally, each
    fifth stroke is made across the first four. This makes it easy to
    count the entries and enter the frequency of each observation.

3.  Check that the frequencies sum to the total number of observations

## Grouped frequency distribution

Data below gives the body masses of 22 patients, measured to the nearest
kilogram.

```{r mass, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Body masses of 22 patients',out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image5.png"))
```

It can be seen that the minimum and the maximum body masses are 42 kg
and 83 kg, respectively. A frequency distribution giving every body mass
between 42 kg and 83 kg would be very long and would not be very
informative. The problem is to overcome by grouping the data into
classes.\
If we choose the classes\
41 -- 49\
50 -- 58\
59 -- 67\
68 -- 76 and 77 -- 85, we obtain the frequency distribution given below:

```{r grptable, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Grouped Frequency distribution table',out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image6.png"))
```

Above table gives the frequency of each group or class; it is therefore
called a grouped frequency table or a grouped frequency distribution.
Using this grouped frequency distribution, it is easier to obtain
information about the data than using the raw data. For instance, it can
be seen that 17 of the 22 patients have body masses between 50 kg and 76
kg (both inclusive). This information cannot easily be obtained from the
raw data.\
It should be noted that, even though above table is concise, some
information is lost. For example, the grouped frequency distribution
does not give us the exact body masses of the patients. Thus the
individual body masses of the patients are lost in our effort to obtain
an overall picture.

## Terms used in grouped frequency tables.

**Class limits**

The intervals into which the observations are put are called [class
intervals]{.underline}. The end points of the class intervals are called
[class limits]{.underline}. For example, the class interval 41 -- 49,
has lower class limit 41 and upper class limit 49.

**Class boundaries**

The raw data in the above example were recorded to the nearest kilogram.
Thus, a body mass of 49.5kg would have been recorded as 50 kg, a body
mass of 58.4 kg would have been recorded as 58 kg, while a body mass of
58.5 kg would have been recorded as 59 kg. It can therefore be seen
that, the class interval 50 -- 58, consists of measurements greater than
or equal to 49.5 kg and less than 58.5 kg. The numbers 49.5 and 58.5 are
called the lower and upper boundaries of the class interval 50 -- 58.
The class boundaries of the other class intervals are given below:

```{r clsslmt, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Class boundary and class limits',out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image7.png"))
```

[Note:]{.underline}\
Notice that the lower class boundary of the i^th^ class interval is the
mean of the lower class limit of the class interval and the upper class
limit of the (i-1)^th^ class interval (i = 2, 3, 4, ...). For example,
in the table above the lower class boundaries of the second and the
fourth class intervals are (50 + 49) /2 = 49.5 and (68 + 67)/2 = 67.5
respectively.\
It can also be seen that the upper class boundary of the i^th^ class
interval is the mean of the upper class limit of the class interval and
the lower class limit of the (i+1)^th^ class interval (i = 1, 2, 3,
...). Thus, in the above table the upper class boundary of the fourth
class interval is (76 + 77)/2 = 76.5.

**Class mark**\
The mid-point of a class interval is called the class mark or class
mid-point of the class interval. It is the average of the upper and
lower class limits of the class interval. It is also the average of the
upper and lower class boundaries of the class interval. For example, in
the table, the class mark of the third class interval was found as
follows: class mark =(59+67) /2 = (58.5 + 67.5)/2= 63.

**Class width**\
The difference between the upper and lower class boundaries of a class
interval is called the class width of the class interval. Class widths
of class intervals can also be found by subtracting two consecutive
lower class limits, or by subtracting two consecutive upper class
limits.

[Note:]{.underline}

The width of the i^th^ class interval is the numerical difference
between the upper class limits of the i^th^ and the ( i-1)^th^ class
intervals (i = 2, 3, ...). It is also the numerical difference between
the lower class limits of the i^th^ and the (i+1) ^th^ class intervals
(i = 1, 2, ...).

In grouped frequency table above the width of the first class interval
is \|41-50\| = 9. This is the numerical difference between the lower
class limits of the first and the second class intervals. The width of
the second class interval is \|50-59\|= 9. This is the numerical
difference between the lower class limits of the second and the third
class intervals. It is also equal to \|58-49\| the numerical, difference
between the upper class limits of the first and the second class
intervals.

## Construction of frequency distribution table

**Step 1**. Decide how many classes you wish to use.\
**Step 2**. Determine the class width\
**Step 3**. Set up the individual class limits  
**Step 4**. Tally the
items into the classes\
**Step 5**. Count the number of items in each class

I will explain the construction process with the example below:  

>An agricultural student measured the lengths of leaves on an oak tree (to the nearest cm). Measurements on 38 leaves are as follows  

>9,16,13,7,8,4,18,10,17,18,9,12,5,9,9,16,1,8,17,1,10,5,9,11,15,6,14,9,1,12,5,16,4,16,8,15,14,17  


**Step 1.** Decide how many classes you wish to use.

H.A. Sturges provides a formula for determining the approximation number
of classes.  
$$\mathbf{k^{'} = 1 + 3.322}\mathbf{\log}\mathbf{N}$$  
If $k^{'}$ is a decimal value, then the Number of classes (*k*) is obtained by rounding $k^{'}$ to the nearest higher integer.  

If $k^{'}$ is an integer,the number of classes (*k*) is equal to $k^{'}$.  

In our example *N*=38, so $k^{'}$=1+3.322×log(38) = 1+3.322×1.5797 = 6.24  
here $k^{'}$ is a decimal value so it is rounded to next higher integer, that is 7  

So the number of classes (*k*) = 7  

**Step 2.** Determine the class width (*C*)

Generally, the class width should be the same size for all classes. Formula for calculating approximate number of classes is  
$$C^{'} = {| max -min|\over k^{'}}$$  
Note that $k^{'}$ used here is the approximation number of classes using Struges formula not the rounded number of class (*k*).  

If $C^{'}$ is a decimal value, then the class width (*C*) is obtained by rounding $C^{'}$ to the nearest higher integer.  

If $C^{'}$ is an integer,the class width (*C*) is equal to $C^{'}$. 

For this example, $C^{'}$ = \| 18− 1\|/**6.24** = 2.72, here $C^{'}$ is a decimal value so it is rounded to next higher integer, that is 3. so class width *C* = 3.  

**Step 3.** To set up the individual class limits, We need to find the
lower limit only

$$L = min - \frac{C \times k - (max - min)}{2}$$

where *C* and *k* here are class width and number of classes respectively in our example  

$L = 1 - \frac{3 \times 7 - (18 - 1)}{2}$=1-2= -1; since there is no
negative values in data = 0.  


```{r ch1, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dt<-read.csv("csv/c1e1.csv")
dt %>%
  kbl(booktabs = TRUE, align = "c") %>%
   kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")


```

Even though the student only measured in whole numbers, the data is
continuous, so "4 cm" means the actual value could have been anywhere
from 3.5 cm to 4.5 cm.

## Cumulative frequency

In many situations, we are not interested in the number of observations
in a given class interval, but in the number of observations which are
less than (or greater than) a specified value. For example, in the above
table, it can be seen that 3 leaves have length less than 3.5 cm and 9
leaves (i.e. 3 + 6) have length less than 6.5 cm. These frequencies are
called cumulative frequencies. A table of such cumulative frequencies is
called **a cumulative frequency table** or **cumulative frequency
distribution**.

Cumulative frequency is defined as a running total of frequencies.
Cumulative frequency can also defined as the sum of all previous
frequencies up to the current point. Notice that the last cumulative
frequency is equal to the sum of all the frequencies. Two types of
cumulative frequencies are Less than cumulative frequency and Greater
than cumulative frequency. Less than cumulative frequency (LCF) is the
number of values less than a specified value. Greater than cumulative
frequency (GCF) is the number of observations greater than a specified
value.

The specified value for LCF in the case of grouped frequency
distribution will be upper limits and for GCF will be the lower limits
of the classes. LCF's are obtained by adding frequencies in the
successive classes and GCF are obtained by subtracting the successive
class frequencies from the total frequency.

## Relative frequency

It is sometimes useful to know the proportion, rather than the number,
of values falling within a particular class interval. We obtain this
information by dividing the frequency of the particular class interval
by the total number of observations. **Relative frequency** of a class
is the frequency of class / total observation. Relative frequencies all
add up to 1.  

```{r ch2, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dt<-read.csv("csv/c1e2.csv")
dt %>%
  kbl(booktabs = TRUE,align = "c") %>%
   kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
   add_footnote("Note: A= Less than cumulative frequency; B= Greater than cumulative frequency, C = Relative frequency", notation="alphabet")
```
