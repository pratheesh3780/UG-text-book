# Measures of Dispersion

We discussed in previous lectures, how a set of data can be summarized
by a single representative value which describes the central value of
the data. Consider the two sets of data A & B below  


| Data sets |    |   |   |   |   |   |
|-----------|----|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A**         | 1  | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| **B**         | -1 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 8 |  


You can see mean, median and mode for both the sets **A** & **B** is 3

See the dot diagrams of data sets A and B.

```{r d, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Scatter diagram of data sets A & B',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image2_d.jpeg"))
```

It can be seen that, while values of data set **A** are grouped close to
their mean, while the values of data set **B** are more spread out. We
say that values of data set **B** are more dispersed (or scattered) than
those of data set **A**

This example shows that the mean, the mode and the median, are not
enough in describing a set of data. In addition to using these measures,
we need a numerical measure of dispersion (or variation) of a set of
data.

Statistical dispersion means the extent to which a numerical data is
likely to vary about an average value.

## Characteristics of a good measure of dispersion  

An ideal measure of dispersion is expected to possess the following
properties

1.  It should be rigidly defined

2.  It should be based on all the items.

3.  It should not be unduly affected by extreme items.

4.  It should lend itself for algebraic manipulation.

5.  It should be simple to understand and easy to calculate

The most important measures of dispersion are the **Range**, the
**Inter-quartile range**, **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**and the **standard deviation**.

## The Range

This is the simplest possible measure of dispersion. The range of a set
of data is defined as the difference between the largest observation and
the smallest observation in the set of data.

Thus,

**Range = largest observation -- smallest observation.**

In symbols, Range = L -- S.

Where L = Largest value; S = Smallest value.

In individual observations and discrete series, L and S are easily
identified. In continuous series, the following two methods are
followed.

### Method 1

L = Upper boundary of the highest class

S = Lower boundary of the lowest class.

### Method 2

L = Mid-value of the highest class.

S = Mid-value of the lowest class.

**Example 5.1**: The marks obtained by 8 students in Mathematics and
Physics examinations are as follows:

Mathematics: 35, 60, 70, 40, 85, 96, 55, 65.

Physics: 50, 55, 70, 65, 89, 68, 72, 80.

Find the ranges of the two sets of data. Are the Physics marks more
dispersed than the Mathematics marks?

**Solution**

For Mathematics,

Highest mark = 96, lowest mark = 35, range =96 -- 35 = 61

For Physics,

Highest mark = 89, lowest mark = 50, range =89 -- 50 = 39.

The mathematics marks have a wider range than the Physics marks. The
Mathematics marks are therefore more dispersed than the Physics marks.

**Example 5.2**: Calculate range from the following distribution

  Size     60-63   63-66   66-69   69-72   72-75
  -------- ------- ------- ------- ------- -------
  Number   5       18      42      27      8

**Solution**

L = Upper boundary of the highest class = 75

S = Lower boundary of the lowest class = 60

Range = L -- S = 75 -- 60 = 15

### Merits and Demerits of Range  

**[Merits]{.ul}**

1.  It is simple to understand.

2.  It is easy to calculate.

3.  In certain types of problems like quality control, weather
    forecasts, share price analysis, etc.

**[Demerits]{.ul}**

1.  It is very much affected by the extreme items.

2.  It is based on only two extreme observations.

3.  It cannot be calculated from open-end class intervals.

4.  It is not suitable for mathematical treatment.

5.  It is a very rarely used measure.  

## The Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or Midspread

The range has the advantage that it is quick and easy to calculate.
However, since it depends only on the maximum and the minimum values of
a set of data, it does not show how the whole data is distributed
between these two values. The range is therefore not a good measure of
dispersion if one or both of these two values differ greatly from other
values of the data. To overcome this problem, we sometimes use the
inter-quartile range. A robust measure of dispersion is the
inter-quartile range. The inter-quartile range of a set of data is the
difference between the upper and lower quartiles of the data. Thus,

**Inter-Quartile Range (IQR)** = *Q*~3~ -- *Q*~1~.

The inter-quartile range of a set of data is therefore not affected by
values of the data outside *Q*~1~ and *Q*~3~. The inter-quartile range
is sometimes used as a measure of dispersion.

**Example 5.3**: Consider the two sets of data below, find IQR

**A**: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15

**B**: 3, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 15

For data set A, *Q*~1~ = 5, *Q*~3~ = 10; so Inter-Quartile Range =10 --
5 = 5

For data set B, *Q*~1~ = 8, *Q*~3~ = 10; so Inter-Quartile Range =10 --
8 = 2

Since the inter-quartile range of data set A is greater than that of
data set B, these results confirm that data set A is more dispersed than
data set B. You can also see Range is same for both the sets.


## Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)

The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is a measure of variability that
indicates the average distance between observations and their mean. MAD
uses the original units of the data, which simplifies interpretation.
Larger values signify that the data points spread out further from the
average. Conversely, lower values correspond to data points bunching
closer to it. The mean absolute deviation is also known as the mean
deviation and average absolute deviation.

Here is how to calculate the mean absolute deviation.

1.  Calculate the mean.

2.  Calculate the difference of each observation from mean and take
    absolute value *i*.*e*. ignore the sign. This difference is known as
    absolute deviation

3.  Add those deviations together.

4.  Divide the sum by the number of data points.

$$MAD = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left| x_{i} - \overline{x} \right|}{n}$$

**Example 5.4**: find the mean absolute deviation of the following 10, 15,
15, 17, 18, 21

  Sl.No.   $$x_{i}$$             $$x_{i} - \overline{x}$$   $$\left| x_{i} - \overline{x} \right|$$
  -------- --------------------- -------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  1        10                    -6                         6
  2        15                    -1                         1
  3        15                    -1                         1
  4        17                    1                          1
  5        18                    2                          2
  6        21                    5                          5
           $\overline{x} =$ 16                              $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left| x_{i} - \overline{x} \right|$ = 16

Here n = 6 and $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left| x_{i} - \overline{x} \right|$ =
16 therefore MAD = $\frac{16}{6} = 2.67$  

### Merits and Demerits of MAD 

**[Merits]{.ul}**

1.  Simple And Easy

2.  Different items of observations can be easily compared with mean deviation  

3.  Mean deviation is better than quartile deviation and range because it is based on all the observations of the series.  

4. Mean deviation is less affected by the extreme values in the series while comparing to standard deviation.  

5. Mean deviation is rigidly defined. So, it has fixed value.  


**[Demerits]{.ul}**

1. It becomes difficult to compute mean deviation in case of fractions.  

2.  Mean deviation is not applicable for algebraic calculations.  

3.  It cannot be calculated from open-end class intervals.

4.  Mean deviation is not a good measure as it ignores negative signs of deviations.  

## The variance and standard deviation

The most important measures of variability are the sample variance and
the sample standard deviation. If *x*~1~, *x*~2~... *x*~n~ is a sample
of *n* observations, then the **sample variance** is denoted by *s*² and
is defined by the equation.

$${\mathbf{\text{sample variance}},\ \mathbf{s}}^{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{=}\frac{\sum_{\mathbf{i = 1}}^{\mathbf{n}}\left( \mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{-}\overline{\mathbf{x}} \right)^{\mathbf{2}}}{\mathbf{n - 1}}$$

The sample **standard deviation**, *s*, is the positive square root of
the sample variance.

$$\mathbf{variance =}\left( \mathbf{\text{standard deviation}} \right)^{\mathbf{2}}$$

$$\mathbf{standard\ deviation = \ }\sqrt{\mathbf{\text{variance}}}$$

**Note**: If *s*~A~, the standard deviation of data set A, is greater
than *s*~B~, the standard deviation of data set B, then data set A is
more dispersed than data set B. It should be noted that the standard
deviation of a set of data is a non-negative number.

**Example 5.4**: Consider the two sets of data A & B below; find standard
deviation?

  **A**   1    2   3   3   4   5
  ------- ---- --- --- --- --- ---
  **B**   -1   0   3   3   5   8  
  
  **Solution**:    
  

  **Set A**

$${Sample\ variane,\ s}_{B}^{2} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)^{2}}{n - 1} = \frac{54}{5} = 10.8$$

$$sample\ standard\ deviation,\ s_{B} = \ \sqrt{s_{B}^{2}} = \ \sqrt{10.8} = 3.29$$

It can be seen that $s_{B} > s_{A}\ $, confirming that data set B is
more dispersed than data set A (see the dot diagrams)

>**Note**: The unit of measurement of the sample variance is the square
of the unit of measurement of the data. Sample standard deviation has
same unit of measurement as of the data. Thus, if *x* is measured in
centimetres (cm), then the unit of measurement of the sample variance is
cm^2^ and that of sample standard deviation is cm. The standard
deviation has the desirable property of measuring variability in the
same unit as the data.

**An alternative formula for computing the variance**

The computation of *s*² requires calculations of $\overline{x}$, *n*
subtractions and *n* squaring and adding operations. If the original
observations or the deviations $\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)$ are
not integers, the deviations $\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)$ may
be difficult to work with, and several decimals may have to be carried
to ensure numerical accuracy. A more efficient computational formula for
*s*² is given by

$s^{2} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\left\{ \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{x_{i}^{2} - \frac{1}{n}}\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i} \right)^{2} \right\}$

; here *n* = 9

$s^{2} = \frac{1}{8}\left\{ 700 - {\frac{1}{9}\left( 72 \right)}^{2} \right\}$

### Variance and standard deviation for grouped data  

#### For discrete grouped data

$$s^{2} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\left\{ \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{{f_{i}x}_{i}^{2} - \frac{1}{n}}\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}x}_{i} \right)^{2} \right\}$$

where $f_{i}$ is the frequency of *i*^th^ observation

**Example 5.6**: The frequency distributions of seed yield of 50 sesamum
plants are given below. Find the standard deviation.

$$s^{2} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\left\{ \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{{f_{i}x}_{i}^{2} - \frac{1}{n}}\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}x}_{i} \right)^{2} \right\}$$

$${sample\ variance,\ s}^{2} = \frac{1}{50 - 1}\left\{ 1537 - \frac{271^{2}}{50} \right\} = 1.3914$$

where $f_{i}$ is the frequency of *i*^th^ class, *c* is the class
interval, $d_{i} = \frac{x_{i} - A}{c}$, $x_{i}$ is the class mark, $A$
is the class mark with the highest frequency

### Merits and Demerits of Standard Deviation  

**[Merits]{.ul}**

1.  It is rigidly defined and its value is always definite and based on
    all the observations

2.  As it is based on arithmetic mean, it has all the merits of
    arithmetic mean.

3.  It is the most important and widely used measure of dispersion.

4.  It is possible for further algebraic treatment.

5.  It is less affected by the fluctuations of sampling and hence
    stable.

6.  It is the basis for measuring the coefficient of correlation and
    other measures.

**[Demerits]{.ul}**

1.  It is not easy to understand and it is difficult to calculate.

2.  It gives more weight to extreme values because the values are
    squared up.

3.  As it is an absolute measure of variability, it cannot be used for
    the purpose of comparison.

## Coefficient of Variation (relative measure of dispersion)

The Standard deviation is an absolute measure of dispersion. It is
expressed in terms of units in which the original figures are collected
and stated. The standard deviation of heights of plants cannot be
compared with the standard deviation of weights of the grains, as both
are expressed in different units, *i*.*e* heights in centimetre and
weights in kilograms.

Therefore the standard deviation must be converted into a relative
measure of dispersion for the purpose of comparison. The relative
measure is known as the **coefficient of variation**. The coefficient of
variation is obtained by dividing the standard deviation by the mean and
expressed in percentage.

$$\mathbf{\text{Coefficient of variation}}\left( \mathbf{C}\mathbf{.}\mathbf{V} \right)\mathbf{=}\frac{\mathbf{\text{standard deviation}}}{\mathbf{\text{mean}}}\mathbf{\times 100}$$

If we want to compare the variability of two or more series, we can use
C.V. The series or groups of data for which the C.V. is greater indicate
that the group is more variable, less stable, less uniform, less
consistent or less homogeneous. If the C.V. is less, it indicates that
the group is less variable or more stable or more uniform or more
consistent or more homogeneous.

**Example 5.8**: Consider the measurement on yield and plant height of a
paddy variety. The mean and standard deviation for yield are 50 kg and
10 kg respectively. The mean and standard deviation for plant height are
55 cm and 5 cm respectively. Compare the variability.

**Solution**:

Here the measurements for yield and plant height are in different units.
Hence the variability can be compared only by using coefficient of
variation.

For yield, CV=$\ \frac{10}{50} \times 100 =$ 20%

For plant height, CV=
$\frac{5}{55} \times 100 = \ $`<!-- -->`{=html}9.1%

The yield is subject to more variation than the plant height.
