# Skewness and Kurtosis  

In the previous lectures we have learned numerical measures of central
tendency and dispersion, but what about measures of shape?

The histogram can give you a general idea on the shape of the
distribution of values in your data. But we need some numerical measures
to identify the shape of the distribution. The numerical measures which
deal with the shape of the distribution are Skewness and Kurtosis.

## Skewness

Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of
symmetry. Then you may ask, what will a symmetric distribution looks
like. Histogram of a symmetric distribution is showed below:

```{r hs, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Histogram of a symmetric distribution',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Hist1.png"))
```

A distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the
left and right of the centre point. In our discussion we are including
only unimodal cases.

For a symmetric distribution skewness = 0; mean = median = mode

```{r hs1, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='symmetric distribution',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image3_5.jpeg"))
```
Example of a data set with skewness = 0 (symmetric distribution)

```{r sk0, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Data set with skewness = 0',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image4_5.jpeg"))
```

### Left-skewed or negatively skewed

For negatively skewed data set or distribution, the left tail is longer;
the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right of the figure.
The distribution is said to be left-skewed, left-tailed, or skewed to
the left, considering that there is a long tail in the left side. See
the figure below, you can also see Mean \< Median \< Mode.

```{r sk1, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Left skewed or negatively skewed distribution',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image5_5.jpeg"))
```
Example of a data set with negative skewness

```{r sk3, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Negatively skewed data set',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image6_5.jpeg"))
```

### Right-skewed or positively skewed

For positively skewed data set or distribution, the right tail is
longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left of the
figure. The distribution is said to be right-skewed, right-tailed, or
skewed to the right, considering that there is a long tail in the right
side. See the figure below, you can also see Mean \> Median \> Mode

```{r sk4, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Right skewed or positively skewed distribution',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image7_5.jpeg"))
```

Example of a data set with positive skewness

```{r sk5, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Data set with positive skewness (right skewed)',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image8_5.jpeg"))
```

## Measures of Skewness 

The direction and extent of skewness can be measured in various ways. We
shall discuss four measures.

### Karl Pearson's coefficient of Skewness (**$S_{k}$**)

You have noticed that the mean, median and mode are not equal in a
skewed distribution. The Karl Pearson\'s measure of skewness is based
upon the divergence of mean from mode in a skewed distribution.

$$S_{k} = \frac{mean - mode}{\text{standard deviation}}$$

The sign of $S_{k}$ gives the direction of skewness and its magnitude
gives the extent of skewness. If $S_{k}$ \> 0, the distribution is
positively skewed, and if $S_{k}$ \< 0 it is negatively skewed.

In the above formula since mode is used, there is a problem that if mode
is not defined for a distribution we cannot find $S_{k}$. But empirical
relation between mean, median and mode states that, for a moderately
symmetrical distribution$\ mean - mode \approx 3(mean - median)$. So the
above formula can be written as

$$S_{k} = \frac{3(mean - median)}{\text{standard deviation}}$$

**Example 6.1**: Compute the Karl Pearson\'s coefficient of skewness from
the following data:

  **Sum**            **187**               **11482**        **705588**

Mean,
$\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}x_{i}}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f_{i}}$
= $\frac{11482}{187} = 61.40$

${sample\ variance,\ s}^{2} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\left\{ \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{{f_{i}x}_{i}^{2} - \frac{1}{n}}\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{f_{i}x}_{i} \right)^{2} \right\}$=
$\frac{705588 - \frac{\left( 11482 \right)^{2}}{187}}{186} = 3.123$

$standard\ deviation,\ s = \sqrt{3.123} = 1.179$

Median: See in the cumulative frequencies, the value just greater
than$\ \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right)$ , then the corresponding value of
$x$ is $Q_{2}$, median

$\left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right) = \frac{187 + 1}{2}\ $= $\frac{188}{2}$
= 94

  Height (*x*)   frequency (*f*)   cumulative frequency
  -------------- ----------------- ----------------------
  58             10                10
  59             18                28
  60             30                58
  61             42                100
  62             35                135
  63             28                163
  64             16                179
  65             8                 187

$$S_{k} = \frac{3(mean - median)}{\text{standard deviation}}$$

$$S_{k} = \frac{3(61.40 - 61)}{1.179} = \frac{1.2}{1.179} = 1.017$$

Hence, the Karl Pearson\'s coefficient of skewness $S_{k}$=$1.017$, Thus
the distribution is positively skewed.

### Bowley\'s measure of Skewness (*S*~Q~)

Karl Pearson\'s coefficient of skewness is most commonly used skewness
measure. However, in order to use it you must know the mean, mode (or
median) and standard deviation for your data. Sometimes you might not
have that information; instead you might have information about
quartiles. If that's the case, you can use Bowley's measure of Skewness
as an alternative to find out more about the asymmetry of your
distribution. It's very useful if you have extreme data values
(outliers) or if you have an open-ended distribution.

$${Bowley’s\ measure\ of\ Skewness,\ S}_{Q} = \frac{\left( Q_{3} - Q_{2} \right) - \left( Q_{2} - Q_{1} \right)}{\left( Q_{3} - Q_{2} \right) + \left( Q_{2} - Q_{1} \right)}$$

Where $Q_{1}$= 1^st^ quartile; $Q_{2}$ = median; $Q_{3}$= 3^rd^ quartile

Equation can be further modified into

$$S_{Q} = \frac{Q_{3} - 2Q_{2} + Q_{1}}{Q_{3} - Q_{1}}$$

-   $S_{Q}$= 0 means that the curve is symmetrical.

-   $S_{Q}$ \> 0 means the curve is positively skewed.

-   $S_{Q}$\< 0 means the curve is negatively skewed.

For **Example 6.1** given above, Bowley\'s measure of Skewness can be
calculated as follows

  Height (*x*)   frequency (*f*)   cumulative frequency
  -------------- ----------------- ----------------------
  58             10                10
  59             18                28
  60             30                58
  61             42                100
  62             35                135
  63             28                163
  64             16                179
  65             8                 187

Calculation of$\text{Q}_{1}$, $Q_{2}$, $Q_{3}$ is given in Section \@ref(quartile)

$${Q}_{1} = 60$$

$$Q_{2} = 61$$

$$Q_{3} = 63$$

$$S_{Q} = \frac{63 - (2 \times 61) + 60}{63 - 60} = \ \frac{1}{3} = 0.33$$

Since $S_{Q}$ \> 0 means the curve is positively skewed.

### Kelly\'s Measure of Skewness (*S*~p~)

Bowley\'s measure of skewness is based on the middle 50% of the
observations; it leaves 25% of the observations on each extreme of the
distribution. As an improvement over Bowley\'s measure, Kelly has
suggested a measure based on Percentiles, including *P*~10~ and *P*~90~
so that only 10% of the observations on each extreme are ignored.

$${Kelly's\ Measure\ of\ Skewness,\ S}_{p} = \frac{\left( P_{90} - P_{50} \right) - \left( P_{50} - P_{10} \right)}{\left( P_{90} - P_{50} \right) + \left( P_{50} - P_{10} \right)}$$

### Measure based on moments

Before going into measuring skewness using moments, one should know what
a moment is:

#### Moments

The ***r*^th^ moment about mean** of a distribution, denoted by
***μ*~r~** is given by

$$\mu_{r} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)^{r}}}{N}$$

Where $f_{i}$ is the frequency of *i*^th^ observation or class
mark$\ x_{i}$, $N = \sum_{}^{}f_{i}$, number of observations

Moment about mean is also called as **Central Moment**

If *r* = 0,
$\mu_{0} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)^{0}}}{N}$
= 1

If *r* = 1,
$\mu_{1} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)^{1}}}{N}$
= 0 (sum of deviation about mean is zero)

If *r* = 2,
$\mu_{2} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{f_{i}\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)^{2}}}{N}$
= $\sigma^{2}$, Population variance

In short values of following moments about mean are

+------------------------+----------------+
| **Moments about mean** | **Value**      |
|                        |                |
| **(central moment)**   |                |
+========================+================+
| $$\mu_{0}$$            | 1              |

#### Moment Measure of Skewness $\mathbf{(}\beta_{1}\text{and}$$\gamma_{1}\mathbf{)}$

The moment measure of skewness is based on the property that, for a
symmetrical distribution, all odd ordered central moments are equal to
zero. We note that $\mu_{1}$ = 0, for every distribution, therefore, the
lowest order moment that can provide an absolute measure of skewness
is$\text{μ}_{3}$. So measures of skewness are based
on$\text{μ}_{3}$.

$$\beta_{1} = \frac{\mu_{3}^{2}}{\mu_{2}^{3}}$$

Pronounced as 'beta one'

$\beta_{1}$= 0 means that the curve is symmetrical. The greater the
value of $\beta_{1}$the more skewed the distribution. One serious
limitation of $\beta_{1}$is that it cannot tell the direction of
skewness, *i*.*e*., whether it is positive or negative. Since
$\text{μ}_{2}$ is always positive and $\mu_{3}^{2}$ is positive,
$\beta_{1}$ will be positive always. This drawback is removed by
calculating$\text{γ}_{1}$, called as Karl Pearson's$\text{ γ}_{1}$,
pronounced as 'gamma one'.

$$\gamma_{1} = \sqrt{\beta_{1}} = \frac{\mu_{3}}{\mu_{2}^{3}}$$

If $\mu_{3}$ is positive $\gamma_{1}$ is positive, If $\mu_{3}$ is
negative $\gamma_{1}$ is negative

-   $\gamma_{1}$= 0 means that the curve is symmetrical.

-   $\gamma_{1}$ \> 0 means the curve is positively skewed.

-   $\gamma_{1}$\< 0 means the curve is negatively skewed.

For the **Example 6.1** given above, skewness can be examined as below

$\mu_{3}$= 0.226

$\mu_{2}$= 3.123

$\beta_{1} = \frac{\mu_{3}^{2}}{\mu_{2}^{3}}$ =
$\frac{\left( 0.226 \right)^{2}}{\left( 3.123 \right)^{3}} = \ \frac{0.051}{30.46} = 0.0016$

$\gamma_{1} = \sqrt{\beta_{1}} = \ \sqrt{0.0016} = + 0.04$

Since $\mu_{3}$ is positive $\gamma_{1}$is positive. Since
$\gamma_{1}$is slightly greater than 0, distribution is a slightly
skewed to right.

## Kurtosis

Kurtosis is another measure of the shape of a distribution. Whereas
skewness measures the lack of symmetry of the frequency curve of a
distribution, kurtosis is a measure of the relative peakedness of its
frequency curve. Various frequency curves can be divided into three
categories depending upon the shape of their peak.

```{r k1, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Three categories of frequency curves depending upon the shape of their peak',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image10_5.jpeg"))
```

Kurtosis refers to degree of flatness or peakedness of the curve. It is
measured relative to the peakedness of normal curve. The normal curve is considered as *mesokurtic*. If a curve is
more peaked than normal curve, it is called *leptokurtic*. If a curve is
more flat-topped than normal curve, it is called *platykurtic*.

The condition of peakedness (leptokurtic) or flatness (platykurtic) is
called **kurtosis of excess**.

Measure of kurtosis is given by 'beta two' given by Karl Pearson

$\beta_{2} = \frac{\mu_{4}}{\mu_{2}^{2}}$

Where $\mu_{4}$ is the 4^th^ central moment, $\mu_{2}$ is the 2^nd^
central moment

-   $\beta_{2}$= 3 means that the curve is mesokurtic.

-   $\beta_{2}$ \> 3 means the curve is leptokurtic.

-   $\beta_{2}$\< 3 means the curve is platykurtic.

Another measure of kurtosis is gamma two, $\gamma_{2} = \beta_{2} - 3\ $

-   $\gamma_{2}$= 0 means that the curve is mesokurtic.

-   $\gamma_{2}$ \> 0 means the curve is leptokurtic.

-   $\gamma_{2}$\< 0 means the curve is platykurtic.

For the **Example 6.1** given above, kurtosis can be examined as follows

  Height ($x_{i}$)   frequency ($f_{i}$)   $$\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)^{4}$$   $${f_{i}\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)}^{4}$$

$\beta_{2} = \frac{\mu_{4}}{\mu_{2}^{2}} = \frac{23.062}{\left( 3.123 \right)^{2}} = 2.364$

$\beta_{2}$ is 2.364, which is close to 3, distribution can be considered
slightly platykurtic close to symmetric.

You can verify the frequency curve of **Example 6.1** below, it can be seen
that it is slightly right tailed (positively skewed)
